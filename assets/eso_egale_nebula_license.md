Usage rights Q&A

    Our basic intention is to encourage the use of our images, videos, press releases, announcements, pictures of the week and captions and we take a common-sense approach to crediting: our only concern is that you credit clearly, visibly and unambiguously and that the credit is not separated from the image/footage/text. We understand that the most appropriate way of doing so may vary from case to case. See the Q&A below for some common examples.

    Q: I want to use the footage in a YouTube video. Is it OK just to put the credit in the text description that appears next to the video?
    A: No, as this is hidden inside a tab. Also it is not visible if the video is embedded in another website. Please include the full credit ‘burned in’ or overlaid on the video, or clearly visible as a credit at the end.

    Q: I want to upload a ESOcast to my YouTube channel, or embed this in my blog. Do I need to add a credit ‘burned in’ or overlaid on the video?
    A: ESOcast  videos already have a credit at the end, so you do not need to edit it.

    Q: I am a producer for a TV programme and wish to use your images and footage. Do I need to overlay the credit on the image?
    A: You do not need to, provided the credit is clearly visible and reproduced in full at the end of the programme.

    Q: I am a picture editor for a newspaper/magazine. Some of your credits are kind of long. Can’t I just use the first part of the credit?
    A: No. Please reproduce the credit in full. This should normally be on the page which the picture is presented on, or on the facing page.

    Q: I am a picture editor for a News Agency. We prefer to use our own name as credit for the images and not tell anyone from where we got them. Is that ok?
    A: No. Please reproduce the credit in full. This should normally be on the page which the picture is presented on, or on the facing page.

    Q: I want to use a picture on the cover of a book/magazine. Does the credit have to appear on the cover?
    A: No. Provided it is clearly visible and identified as being the credit for the cover image, the credit can appear in another prominent place in your publication. This could, for example, be the back cover, the inside front cover or the editorial page.

    Q: Do I need to contact all the people named in the credit line for permission to use an image or video?
    A: No. Images and videos published on eso.org are, unless explicitly stated otherwise, cleared for reuse without needing to contact the individuals or organisations listed. Their names must not be removed from the credit, however.

    Q: Do I need to send you a physical copy of any products I have made using your imagery or footage?
    A: No, an electronic copy (e.g. a photograph or a PDF) is fine.

    Q: I would like to digitally alter or manipulate an image. Is this OK?
    A: Yes.

    Q: I would like to edit, expand or cut text from ESO. Is this OK?
    A: Yes, providing it is a press release, announcement, picture of the week or caption.

    Q: Can I just overlay the ESO logo instead of the credit?
    A: No. The use of the ESO logo is controlled and it must not be reproduced without permission.

    Q: I am a journalist. I want to use the text of a press release in a news report. Do I need to credit you?
    A: No. News media are excepted from the requirement to credit the text of press releases, announcements, pictures of the week or captions. (You must, however, properly credit any images or videos you use).

    Q: I am an editor of a publishing company. I want to use text from ESO in a book. Do I need to credit you?
    A: No, media including book publishers are exempted from crediting text. Please remember that only press releases, announcements, pictures of the week and captions are released under these terms.

    Q: I want to use text from the ESO website, but it is not part of a press release, announcement, picture of the week or caption. Can I still use this?
    A: No, other texts on the ESO website are not released under Creative Commons.

    Q: How should I credit text taken from ESO?
    A: Please credit us as “ESO”.
